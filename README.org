#+TITLE: OXR (Org Experimental Cross-References)

* Introduction

This is an experiment to see what a minimal package to enhance cross-references in org-mode might look like, that might at some point contribute pieces to org.

The general idea is to start with just using internal links, with =cleveref= as output target in LaTeX.

* Features

This package currently supports the following cross-reference target types:
- sections
- figures
- tables
- equations
... and the =oxr-insert-ref= command to insert cross-references to those targets.

It also includes the following convenience commands to make it easy to create cross-reference targets that =oxr-insert-ref= can recognize.
- =oxr-insert-section=
- =oxr-insert-figure=
- =oxr-insert-table=
- =oxr-insert-equation=

Finally, =oxr= can also access targets from included files.

* Screenshot

Figure [[fig-insert-screen]] is a simple screenshot showing the group-based insertion UI.
