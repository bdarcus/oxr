#+TITLE: OXR (Org Experimental Cross-References)

This is an experiment to see what a minimal package to enhance cross-references in org-mode might look like, that might at some point contribute pieces to org.

The general idea is to start with just using internal links, with =cleveref= as output target in LaTeX.

Figure [[fig-insert-screen]] is a simple screenshot showing the group-based insertion UI.

I started this before John Kitchin posted a similar, much more complete, example in the form of [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref/blob/master/org-ref-refproc.el][refproc]].
That, however, is currently included in the much larger org-ref package.
